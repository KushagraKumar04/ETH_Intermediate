# Introduction
This is a simple smart contract designed to demonstrate the usage of require, assert, and revert statements on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Description
The SmartContractProject is implemented in Solidity and showcases the use of require, assert, and revert for input validation and error handling in smart contracts. The purpose of this contract is to serve as a teaching tool for understanding basic smart contract assertions and validations.

# Characteristics
- Contains functions that demonstrate the use of require, assert, and revert statements.
- Ensures input values meet specified conditions to prevent incorrect contract states.
  
# Contract Details:

## Functions
### *requireInstance(uint a1, uint a2):*
This function uses the require statement to ensure that the sum of the inputs a1 and a2 is less than 20. If the condition is not met, it will revert the transaction with an error message.

### *assertInstance(uint b):*
This function uses the assert statement to check that the input b is greater than or equal to 10. If the condition is not met, it will trigger a panic and revert the transaction.

### *revertInstance(uint d, uint e):*
This function uses the revert statement to ensure that the sum of the inputs d and e does not exceed 20. If the condition is not met, it will revert the transaction with an error message.

# Usage

- *Deployment:* Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a compatible Ethereum wallet or development environment.
- *requireInstance Function:* Call the requireInstance function with two unsigned integers. Ensure their sum is less than 20 to avoid transaction reversion.
- *assertInstance Function:* Call the assertInstance function with an unsigned integer. Ensure the value is greater than or equal to 10 to avoid a panic.
- *revertInstance Function:* Call the revertInstance function with two unsigned integers. Ensure their sum does not exceed 20 to avoid transaction reversion.
  
*This smart contract provides a basic yet practical example of using Solidity's require, assert, and revert statements for input validation and error handling.*
